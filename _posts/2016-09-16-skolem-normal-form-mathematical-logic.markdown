**In mathematical logic,** reducing to *skolem normal form* is a method for removing existential quantifiers from formal logic statements -- often performed as the first step in an automated theorem prover. 

A formula of first-order logic is in skolem normal form if it is in prenex normal form with only universal first-order quantifiers. The resulting skolem form is not *necessarily equivalent* to the original one. It only preserves *satisfiability*, i.e. it is satisfiable if and only if the original one is satisfiable.
