## Intuition and Motivation

The idea behind what we call *class* is after we have gone to *infinity* and *beyond that*. 
Let us say there are sets; later, they grow bigger and bigger and become infinite. Then, 
it comes to a question *if the collection of what we have accumulated so far is still a set?*.

**In Naive Set Theory,** one can freely collect all objects which satisfy certain properties into a set. 
Hence, this can easily lead to a paradox. Famous ones are 

* Russell's paradox
* Burali-Forti paradox

## Class

A class is a collection of sets (or mathematical objects) that can be unambiguously defined by a property 
that all its members share. Its precise definition depends on a foundational context. For example, 
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory defines the notion informally whereas Von Neumann-Bernays-Godel set theory define it 
as *entities that are not members of another entity.* 

A class that is not a set is called a *proper class*. On the other hand, a class that is a set may be called a *small class*. 
For example, the class of all ordinal numbers and the class of all sets are proper classes.

In general, the paradoxes of naive set theory explains why *not all classes can be sets*. For example, 
Russell's paradox suggests that *the class of all sets which do not contain themselves* is proper; and 
Burali-Forti paradox suggests that *the class of all ordinal numbers* is proper. 
Hence, the paradoxes tell us that some collections may not be sets. The notion of *proper class* tells us 
that we can still talk about those collections even though they are not sets per se. 
For instance, we can still talk about the collection of all ordinals or prove that some properties hold, 
despite it is not a set, e.g.

* The class of *ordinal numbers* is *well-ordered*.

## Axiomatic Set Theory

Naive set theory may give rise to paradoxes. **Axiomatic set theory** was originally devised to get rid of 
such paradoxes. Today, when mathematicians talk about *set theory* as a field, they usually mean axiomatic set theory. 
Informal applications of set theory in other fields are sometimes referred to as applications of *naive set theory*, but 
are understood to be justified in terms of an axiomatic system. 

Let us note that naive set theory may refer to several distinct notions, e.g.

* Informal presentation of an axiomatic set theory, e.g. as in *Naive Set Theory* by *Paul Halmos*.
* Early or later versions of *Georg Cantor*'s theory and other informal systems.
* Decidedly inconsistent theories (whether axiomatic or not), like a theory of *Gottlob Frege* that yielded 
Russell's paradoxes, and theories of *Giuseppe Peano* and *Rechard Dedekind*.
