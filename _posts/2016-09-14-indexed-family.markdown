In mathematics, an **indexed family** is a collection of values associated with indices. For example, 
a family of real numbers, indexed by the integers is a collection of real numbers, where 
each integer is associated with one of the real numbers. 

Formally, an indexed family is the same thing as a mathematical function, i.e. a function with a domain *J* and 
codomain *X* is equivalent to a family of elements *X* indexed by elements of *J*. Their differences are only conceptual 
basis. Indexed families are interpreted as collections instead of as functions. 

## Examples

Let **n** be the finite set {1, 2, ..., *n*} where *n* is a positive integer. 

1. An ordered pair is a family indexed by the two element set **2** = {1, 2}.
2. An n-tuple is a family indexed by **n**.
3. An infinite sequence is a family indexed by natural number.
4. A list is an *n*-tuple for an unspecified *n*, or an infinite sequence.
5. An *n*x*m* matrix is a family indexed by the cartesian product **nxm**.
6. A net is a family indexed by a directed set.

## Remark: Sequence

Ones may observe that a sequence is a special type of indexed family accompanying the 
notion of ordering, e.g. x_1 is before x_2. This notion is not presented in the indexed family 
unless the indexing set has some sort of order relation defined on it.
