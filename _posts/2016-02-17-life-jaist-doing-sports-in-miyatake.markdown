In **Miyatake**, there is a small gym in which you can do several kinds of sports, viz. Basketball and Badminton. 

Going to the place is quite convenient. It is in walking distance. Normally, I spend around 10 mins (by walk) from JAIST to the gym. **Many JAIST students go there to play basketball on every Friday from 5:30 - 8:30pm.** The gym also opens on other days, but we need to make sure with the staffs at front first. This is because the gym also provides services for Badminton.
According to what I know, the gym **also permit to play basketball on Saturday from 4:30 - 6:30pm.**
