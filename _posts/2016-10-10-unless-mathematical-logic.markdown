X unless Y

The simple way to interpret this statement is as 

* IF not X THEN Y; or
* IF not Y THEN X

**Example**  I will go to the park unless I stay home. 

This means *I will go to the park if I do not stay home*. Precisely speaking, 

* IF not home THEN park; or
* IF not park THEN HOME.
