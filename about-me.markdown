Welcome to Teeradaj's homepage! 

I did my Ph.D. in Information Science (Computational Logic) at [Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/){:target="_blank"} (JAIST). 
Currently, I am a special lecturer at (both public and private) universities and a technological consultant 
(per requested). My research interests are centered on the formalization of human intelligence and engineering 
practices for software production as follows: 
1. Computational logic in artificial intelligence 
  * Knowledge and information can be represented by using diverse formalisms (e.g. description logics, answer set 
  programming, modal logic, argumentation framework, etc.) and different reasoning aspects of logic-based knowledge 
  representation can be employed to discover implicit information. My interests range from theoretical foundation (e.g. 
  expressivity, computational complexity, algorithms) to their areas of practical development (e.g. ontology applications, 
  applications of agent reasoning, and intelligent information systems).
2. Machine learning in artificial intelligence
  * Given a dataset, can we find structured representation inside it? My interest (in this area) lies in the fundamental 
  of machine learning techniques e.g. supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and 
  transfer learning. Regarding the current state-of-the-art works, machine learning is one of the promising techniques 
  that is suitable to deal with natural language processing. My interest also focuses on the study of machine learning 
  techniques to obtain the better achievement. 
3. Engineering disciplines for software production
  * How a software should be built and pushed to production? My interests comprise software engineering disciplines 
  related to all aspects of software production such as business requirement analysis (e.g. Lean startup), software 
  development process and methodologies (e.g. Scrum and LeSS framework), software testing, software architecture, 
  design patterns, and best practices for software development (e.g. continuous integration and continuous delivery). 
  I am also interested in software solutions for large-scaled applications based on cloud computing technologies (e.g. 
  Amazon Web Services). 

Fortunately, not only having academic contributions, I am also interested in social activities for software 
development solutions. Being an open-minded software engineer, I have joined Agile66 community and Thai Programmer 
Association and help organizing conferences in the free time.
